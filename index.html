            <h2>SELF DRIVE CARS IN MUMBAI</h2><br />
            <p>The financial capital of India, Mumbai is a city which never sleeps. Buzzing with activity, it also holds
                the distinction of being the entertainment hub of the country. With a beach in its backyard and the
                picturesque Western Ghats a stone’s throw away, the city attracts visitors from all over the word. From
                the Gateway of India which opens the doors to India’s mysteries, to the ancient caves of Elephanta
                Island, and from the iconic Stock Exchange to the many studios where Bollywood movies are made, the city
                offers a multitude of sights and experiences.
                The downside of life in Mumbai is the difficulty commuting poses. Overloaded public transport and
                increasing distances add to the stress of living in Mumbai. Whether you are a visitor to this
                melting-pot of cultures, or a resident of the city, it is important to have a self-drive car at your
                disposal to make the most of your time. If you do not plan to buy a car of your own, Zoomcar offers the
                perfect solution by making the process of self- drive car booking in Mumbai convenient and affordable.
                The Zoomcar app allows you the freedom of booking a car at your fingertips.</p>
            <h2>CAR ON RENT IN MUMBAI</h2><br />
            <p>On many occasions, working professionals and business persons want to commute to different parts of the
                city in the same day. Usually, they hire a chauffeur driven car and pay extra for the waiting charges.
                This option, while popular, is also more expensive. It is more economical to opt for a self-drive car
                rental in Mumbai. You can spend any amount of time at a meeting without having to worry about the
                waiting charges, and use the car to explore Mumbai after work at your leisure. Zoomcar also provides
                Mumbai airport taxi service, using which you can pick up one of our cars right at the airport when you
                land. We have a variety of cars in our fleet including luxury brands which makes it easier to book
                luxury cars on rent in Mumbai.
            </p>
            <h2>CAR RENTAL IN MUMBAI
            </h2><br />
            <p>An ideal way to relax after a stressful week at the office is to go on a long drive from Mumbai to Pune
                or from Mumbai to Nasik. Enjoy the drive on the wide 6-lane Mumbai – Pune expressway with your loved
                ones by taking a car on hire in Mumbai. There are many religious sites, parks, and museums in Nasik
                which makes it an ideal location to unwind.
            </p>
